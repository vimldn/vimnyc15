Elm Park's <i>'The Shoreline' condo</i> got sued for a 'fitness room' that was just mirrors. Verify <b>gym square footage</b> minimum of 1,500sf in Alt 2 DOB filings.</p> <p>Check equipment brands like <b>Precor or Technogym</b> in the offering plan. Confirm <b>class schedules</b> with Peloton bikes at minimum. Review floor plans for dedicated space, not shared lounge areas.</p> <p>Look for <b>towel service included</b> in common charges. Red flags from BIS lookups include undersized rooms or no ventilation.

Verify <b>24/7 doorman</b>, resort-style pools, and pet spas before deposit. These features define Staten Island new builds in areas like Tottenville and Arden Heights.</p> <p>Context matters for <b>HOA fees</b> and condo fees. Expect higher <b>common charges</b> with premium amenities such as rooftop decks and clubhouses. Review the offering plan for fee breakdowns tied to lifestyle perks.</p> <p>Check operational hours under H3 for operational hour verification and board approval requirements.

Check tile cracks, pump noise, and water clarity during walk-through. Verify heating systems work before <b>final closing</b>.</p> <p>Social areas like BBQ areas and fire pits boost community vibe. Confirm lounge access covers events and <b>children's playroom</b>. These perks justify higher maintenance fees.</p> <h3>Concierge and Security Services</h3><img alt="Concierge and Security Services" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/staten-island-new-builds-amenity-and-fee-checklist-before-you-sign(u50v)_3.jpeg"/> <p>Verify <b>24/7 doorman coverage</b> + 16-camera HD system accessible via app. NYC Local Law 58 requires <b>video retention 30+ days</b>. Essential for peace of mind in new builds.</p> <p>Coverage includes key fob and app access for elevators and lobbies. Response time SLA targets <b>2min lobby</b>, <b>5min residential floors</b>. Test systems during open house visits.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Coverage</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Doorman</td><td>24/7</td><td>Full lobby greeting</td></tr> <tr><td>Concierge</td><td>8am-8pm</td><td>Package handling, reservations</td></tr> <tr><td>Key Fob + App</td><td>24/7</td><td>Entrances, garage, elevators</td></tr> <tr><td>Cameras</td><td>Continuous</td><td>Entrances + garage, app view</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Integrate with smart home tech like Ring doorbells. Review <b>surveillance cameras</b> in the house rules. Factor security into your <b>fee checklist</b> before deposit.</p> <p>Board approval may require proof of need for extras.

Arden Heights condo banned <i>65lb dogs</i> despite advertising. Scrutinize policies upfront.</p> <p>Pet policy checklist caps weight at <b>80lbs max</b>. Demand <b>2,000sf min dog run</b> with turf and fencing. Check for breed restrictions beyond documented attack breeds.</p> <ul><li>Weight limit: 80lbs max per pet</li> <li>Dog run size: 2,000sf minimum, fenced</li> <li>Pet spa fees: $0 or reimbursed via HOA</li> <li>Breed restrictions: None except attack breeds</li> <li>Wash station: Self-serve, 4ft tub minimum</li></ul> <p>Verify <b>pet fees</b> in the offering plan, including move-in deposits. Test spa during model unit tour. Ensures harmony for pet owners in multi-family homes.</p> <p>Green spaces and playgrounds often neighbor dog runs. Review bylaws for noise rules. Avoid surprises at <b>contract signing</b> with full disclosure.</p> <h2>Hidden Fees to Scrutinize</h2> <p>Staten Island condo fees average $0.85/sf (<b>$650 avg 2BR</b>) but capital assessments add to costs annually. Review 3yr budget projections in the offering plan to spot trends. Fees vary by neighborhood, with North Shore at $1.05/sf versus <b>South Shore</b> at $0.72/sf for new builds.</p> <p>These benchmarks set the stage for deeper checks on <b>monthly maintenance charges</b>, move-in costs, and more. Offering plans often bury details on pages 45-60 for reserves and escalations. Homebuyers should compare sq footage fees against comps in St. George or Tottenville before signing.</p> <p><b>Capital improvements</b> and special assessments can surprise new owners in luxury condos or townhouses. Look for <b>421-a tax abatement</b> impacts on common charges. Scrutinize house rules for extras like parking garage fees or EV charging stations.</p> <p>Experts recommend lining up these figures with your fee checklist during attorney review. North Shore new construction often includes higher HOA fees due to waterfront views and ferry access. South Shore townhouses keep costs lower with basic landscaping fees.</p> <h3>Monthly Maintenance Charges</h3><img alt="Monthly Maintenance Charges" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/staten-island-new-builds-amenity-and-fee-checklist-before-you-sign(u50v)_4.jpeg"/> <p><strong>Fee comparison table:</strong> Use this to benchmark <b>Staten Island new builds</b> across types.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Building Type</th><th>Avg $/sf</th><th>Includes</th><th>Excludes</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Condo</td><td>$0.85</td><td>Heat/AC/Utilities</td><td>Cable/Internet</td></tr> <tr><td>Co-op</td><td>$1.12</td><td>Taxes+Insurance</td><td>Sublet fee</td></tr> <tr><td>Townhouse</td><td>$0.45</td><td>Landscaping</td><td>Snow removal</td></tr> <tr><td>North Shore</td><td>$1.05</td><td>Doorman/Security</td><td>Storage units</td></tr> <tr><td>South Shore</td><td>$0.72</td><td>Trash chute/Pool</td><td>Garage fee</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Check 3yr escalation history in offering plan pages 50-55 for patterns. <b>Reserve fund minimums</b> hit 10% of budget, covering gym or rooftop deck repairs. <b>421-a abatement</b> lowers taxes but not always maintenance fees in Elm Park condos.</p> <p>For co-ops, proprietary leases detail common charges excluding sublet fees. Townhouses often skip snow removal, passing it to owners. Compare inclusions like concierge or package room against your amenity checklist.</p> <h3>Move-In and Transfer Costs</h3> <p>Budget $5K+ for move-in deposit (<i>$2,500 typical</i>) + flip tax (2% resale) + elevator overtime (<i>$75/hr after 5pm</i>). These hide in house rules on offering plan page 70. Peak season May-Sep adds <b>25% surcharges</b> for new construction closings.</p> <p><b>Transfer fees</b> run 1-3% of sale price, plus attorney review at $1,500-3K. Board app fees hit $750 for co-ops in New Brighton. Review refund policies, often 30 days post-deposit for earnest money.</p> <p>Move-in fees cover lobby damage from <i>furniture movers</i>, common in multi-family homes. Flip taxes apply to resales, not sponsor units. Time your property purchase outside summer for lower overtime on elevators or parking garage access.</p> <p>Include <b>application fees</b> and pet fees in your closing costs tally. Attorney approval periods flag these in contract riders. Great Kills townhouses charge less for transfers than North Shore luxury condos.</p> <h2>Contract Red Flags Before Signing</h2> <p>Review offering plan amendments and board minutes for the past three years before signing any Staten Island new build contract. The New York Bar Association notes significant litigation over these documents in NYC real estate. Direct your attorney to scrutinize them during the <b>5-business day attorney review period</b>.</p> <p>Focus on <b>amenity sunset clauses</b>, fee escalations, and reserve fund shortfalls common in new construction contracts. Staten Island luxury condos and townhouses often hide restrictions in fine print. Flag these early to avoid surprises at closing.</p> <p>Common issues include <b>pro-rated access fees</b> for gyms, pools, or rooftop decks that balloon post-occupancy. Demand clarity on HOA fees, condo fees, and special assessments. Your buyer's agent can help spot patterns from similar North Shore or South Shore projects.</p> <p>Engage a real estate attorney familiar with Staten Island new builds. They will strike problematic language and add riders for protections like engineering reports. This due diligence protects your investment in multi-family homes or pre-construction units.</p> <h3>Amenity Access Restrictions</h3> <p>Strike <b>'board discretion'</b> amenity clauses and demand 99-year guarantees in Staten Island new builds. Phrases like <b>'subject to board approval'</b> for gym or pool access can lock out owners later. In <i>The Heights</i> condo, the fitness center closed after Year 2 due to <i>'maintenance'</i> claims.</p> <p>Review house rules and bylaws for hidden limits on rooftop decks, dog runs, or concierge services. Sponsors may promise lounge areas or EV charging stations, then restrict them. Insist on a <b>sponsor estoppel letter</b> confirming all advertised amenities.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Red Flag Phrase</th><th>Action</th><th>Reason</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><b>'Subject to board approval'</b></td><td>STRIKE</td><td>Removes owner rights to amenities like fitness centers or pools</td></tr> <tr><td><b>'Temporary amenity'</b></td><td>DEMAND sunset date</td><td>Prevents sudden loss of rooftop gardens or clubhouses</td></tr> <tr><td><b>'Pro-rated access fees'</b></td><td>CAP at 10%</td><td>Controls costs for parking garage or storage units</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>During attorney review, add clauses for <b>permanent access</b> to playgrounds, BBQ areas, or package rooms. Check offering plan amendments for changes to promised features like smart home tech or 24/7 security. This ensures your amenity checklist matches reality before closing.</p> <h3>Escalation Clauses and Caps</h3> <p>Cap annual increases at <b>3% plus CPI</b> and demand a $250K per unit minimum reserve fund in Staten Island new construction contracts. Unchecked escalations lead to steep common charges for maintenance fees or capital improvements. The Eltingville project assessed owners $18K each in Year 3 due to reserve shortfalls.</p> <p>Require reserve triggers like assessments only if funds fall below <b>15% of budget</b>. Insist on an independent <b>engineering report</b> and NYC Local Law 11 compliance before signing. This protects against surprises in snow removal fees, landscaping, or building insurance.</p> <p>Sample clause: <i>"Fees shall not exceed max 3% or CPI, whichever lower, absent reserve triggers."</i> Flag <b>time of essence clauses</b> without mortgage contingency. Review financial statements and reserve studies for South Shore developments like Tottenville or Arden Heights.</p> <p>Your attorney should add riders for <b>NYC DOB</b> filings, Alt 2 compliance, and new building permits during the review period. Demand transparency on flood insurance or pest control costs. This fee checklist safeguards against special assessments in your property purchase.</p>

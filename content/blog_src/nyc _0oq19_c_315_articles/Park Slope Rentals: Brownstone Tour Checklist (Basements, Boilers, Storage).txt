Spend seven minutes inspecting these six critical systems during your brownstone tour. This rental checklist helps spot issues in Brooklyn apartments.</p> <p>Start with the <b>burner ignition</b>. Look for a clean blue flame, which shows proper combustion. Yellow or sooty flames signal dirty burners or poor fuel quality.</p> <p>Check the <b>pressure gauge</b> next. It should read between 30 and 50 psi for safe operation. Low pressure means leaks, while high readings risk damage.</p> <p>Inspect <b>safety valves</b> for leaks. Test the hot water temperature, keeping it at 120 degreesF maximum to avoid scalding. Feel the expansion tank; it should be firm, not spongy.</p> <p>Review <b>service tags</b> for recent maintenance, ideally less than one year old. In Park Slope rentals, reliable <b>boiler functionality</b> ensures comfort in brownstone living.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Gas Boiler</th><th>Oil Boiler</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Age</td><td>Typically 15-25 years</td><td>Often 20-30 years</td></tr> <tr><td>Efficiency</td><td>Higher AFUE ratings</td><td>Lower, needs tuning</td></tr> <tr><td>Cost</td><td>Lower fuel prices</td><td>Higher delivery fees</td></tr> <tr><td>Maintenance</td><td>Annual cleaning</td><td>Frequent filter changes</td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>Boiler Condition and Age</h3> <p>Check the <b>boiler data plate</b> during your apartment viewing. Note the model and serial number; Trane or Weil-McLain units are common in Park Slope apartments. Older units demand closer scrutiny in NYC real estate.</p> <p>Observe the burner flame color. A steady blue flame indicates good condition, while yellow means carbon buildup. This quick check reveals <b>heating system</b> health in Brooklyn brownstones.</p> <p>Look for <b>heat exchanger rust</b> or cracks. Verify aquastat settings around 180 degreesF for firing. Listen to the circulator pump; it should hum smoothly without grinding noises.</p> <p>Gas boilers offer better efficiency than aged models. Newer ones save on fuel compared to 25-year-old units. Prioritize replacement for units over 20 years in your rental inspection.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>AFUE</th><th>Fuel Cost Example</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>New Gas</td><td>95%</td><td>Lower annual bills</td></tr> <tr><td>25-Year-Old</td><td>70%</td><td>Higher heating costs</td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>Ventilation and Safety Features</h3><img alt="Ventilation and Safety Features" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/park-slope-rentals-brownstone-tour-checklist-basements-boilers-storage(v4zp)_4.jpeg"/> <p>Sniff for gas odors and check <b>CO detectors</b> first. Working detectors less than five years old are essential; absent ones violate NYC Fire Code. Protect yourself in every <b>property tour</b>.</p> <p>Ensure the <b>gas shutoff valve</b> is accessible. Clear exhaust venting of blockages like nests or debris. In basement inspection, this prevents carbon monoxide buildup.</p> <p>Confirm the <b>relief valve drain line</b> has proper pitch to the floor. Check electrical panel for GFCI protection near the <b>boiler room</b>. Test water pressure at the nearest faucet; aim for 50-80 psi.</p> <p>These steps cover <b>ventilation</b> and safety in Park Slope housing. Note issues like poor water pressure or missing detectors. They impact brownstone rental decisions during your lease viewing.</p> <h2>Storage Areas Evaluation</h2> <p>Park Slope renters lose listings over <b>inadequate storage</b> in brownstone tours.

This ensures enough space for bikes, clothes, and seasonal items during your rental walkthrough.</p> <p>Start with the <b>bike room</b>, which needs at least 5x2ft per bike for safe parking. Check apartment closets for built-in options versus freestanding units that might wobble.

Look for <b>laundry space</b> with stackable washer-dryer hookups, common in <i>triplex rentals</i>. Utility shelves should hold typical loads without sagging.</p> <p>Use this rental checklist during your brownstone tour to flag issues like cramped bike storage or damp basement areas. Prioritize properties with ample <b>storage units</b> near the garden level or English basement. This step secures your spot in the competitive Park Slope realty market.</p> <h3>Accessibility and Condition</h3> <p>Measure storage clearances during your apartment viewing. Less than <b>30" wide paths</b> block access, echoing ADA guidelines for safe movement.

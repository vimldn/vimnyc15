Dive in!</p><h2>Before Move-In: Apartment Inspection</h2><img alt="Before Move-In: Apartment Inspection" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/nyc-movein-day-prep-what-to-photograph-document-and-confirm(awx8)_1.jpeg"/> <p>In NYC rentals, <b>tenant rights</b> under Real Property Law 235-b require landlords to document the apartment condition at move-in. This protects your <b>security deposit</b> from unfair disputes over pre-existing issues. Experts recommend thorough pre-move documentation to avoid common conflicts.</p> <p>Landlords must provide a habitable space, and you have the right to record everything before signing the <b>lease agreement</b>. Spend 45-60 minutes systematically photographing your New York City rental before the landlord arrives. This creates strong <b>photo evidence</b> for any future claims.</p> <p>Focus on walls, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, and appliances during the <b>walkthrough inspection</b>. Take timestamped photos and videos to capture details like cracks, stains, or scuffs. Always keep originals in cloud storage for <b>damage claim prevention</b>.</p> <p>Prepare a <b>move-in checklist</b> with an inventory list and condition report. Get the landlord to initial it during the inspection. This simple step supports <b>dispute resolution</b> if issues arise later.</p> <h3>Photograph Existing Damage</h3> <p>Use your iPhone's built-in camera with 'Grid' enabled and take 50-75 <b>timestamped photos</b> covering these 12 specific areas before the landlord arrives. Start with full room shots from multiple angles. This establishes the baseline <b>apartment inspection</b> condition.</p> <p>Follow this numbered photo checklist for comprehensive coverage:</p> <ol><li>Full room panoramas from <i>4 angles</i> per space, including closets and shelves.</li> <li>Close-ups of <b>wall cracks</b> wider than 1/8 inch, plus paint condition.</li> <li><b>Door and frame scuffs</b>, dents, and lock functionality.</li> <li><b>Window sill water stains</b>, seals, and glass cracks.</li> <li>Carpet stains marked with colored yarn, hardwood floors, and tiles.</li> <li><b>Ceiling water damage</b> circles, plus light fixtures and smoke detectors.</li></ol> <p>Preserve metadata by keeping originals in iCloud Photos. Export with timestamps via the Files app for your records. Include mirrors, countertops, and fire escapes in balcony units.</p> <p>Photograph <b>electrical outlets</b>, HVAC systems, and carbon monoxide alarms too. This <b>move-in day prep</b> ensures no pre-existing issues get charged to you at move-out.</p> <h3>Document Cleanliness and Appliances</h3> <p>Video walk through each room (3-5 min total) while narrating conditions, then test appliances using this 8-point checklist before move-in. Note cleanliness in bathrooms, kitchen, and cabinets. Check for <b>mold or water damage</b> with close-ups.</p> <p>Use this detailed appliance testing protocol:</p> <ol><li><b>Refrigerator</b>: Set temp to 37 degreesF, test ice maker and door seals.</li> <li><b>Oven and stove</b>: Ensure all burners ignite and oven heats evenly.</li> <li><b>Dishwasher</b>: Run a cycle, check for leaks and complete drainage.</li> <li>Microwave: Confirm turntable spins and no sparking.</li> <li><b>Cabinets and countertops</b>: Inspect for roach droppings or pest signs.</li> <li>Sink, faucet, and plumbing: Test water pressure and drainage.</li> <li>Bathroom fixtures: Flush toilet, run shower and bathtub.</li> <li>Air conditioner, heating, and <b>HVAC system</b>: Verify operation.</li></ol> <p>Document with a moisture meter if possible, aiming below 15% readings. Upload videos and photos to cloud storage with folder structure like 'Apartment-[Address]/Appliances/[Date]'. Narrate issues like <i>loose tiles</i> or <b>stained carpet</b> for clarity.</p> <p>Test <b>doorbell, smart lock</b>, and building amenities access during this step. This thorough video recording supports your <b>condition report</b> and protects against landlord claims.</p> <h3>Confirm Utilities and Keys</h3><img alt="Confirm Utilities and Keys" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/nyc-movein-day-prep-what-to-photograph-document-and-confirm(awx8)_2.jpeg"/> <p>Photograph all <b>utility meters</b> (electricity, gas, water) showing reading + date/time, then test every key received using this verification system. Note initial readings for accurate billing. Confirm <b>internet wiring</b> and cable outlets too.</p> <p>Follow this meter reading and key protocol:</p> <ol><li><b>Front door key</b>: Test lock and deadbolt.</li> <li>Mailbox key: Open and close securely.</li> <li>Super's key if provided, plus laundry room access.</li> <li>Bike room or storage unit keys.</li> <li>Parking spot, gym, or roof deck keys for amenities.</li></ol> <p>Create a simple spreadsheet: <b>Key# | Location | Works? | Spare? | Landlord Initials</b>. Get landlord or super signature on a key handover form before leaving. Reference NYC utility transfer laws to ensure setup.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Key Type</th><th>Location</th><th>Works?</th><th>Spare?</th><th>Initials</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Front Door</td><td>Main Entrance</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>___</td></tr> <tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Lobby</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>___</td></tr> <tr><td>Laundry</td><td>Basement</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>___</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Discuss <b>superintendent contact</b>, maintenance requests, pest control, and garbage disposal rules. Confirm sublet policy, pet rules, and noise guidelines. This <b>key handover</b> prevents move-in day surprises.</p> <h2>Move-In Day: Loading and Transport</h2> <p>NYC moving damage claims spike on weekends. Document truck contents and <b>building access</b> to protect against disputes over disappeared items. NYC DOB loading regulations limit truck parking to <b>20 minutes</b>.</p> <p>Movers need insurance with minimum <b>$0.60 per pound coverage</b>. Confirm this in writing before move-in day. Photo documentation helps prevent content disputes.</p> <p>Start with a move-in checklist for loading. Video pallets and note timestamps. This pre-move documentation supports tenant rights during transport.</p> <p>Plan for NYC traffic and <b>parking spot</b> challenges. Coordinate with your superintendent contact for loading zone access. Secure backups of all files in cloud storage.</p> <h3>Photograph Packed Truck Contents</h3> <p>Create a 25-item video inventory of <b>truck contents</b> using the Inventory Tag System before leaving your old apartment. Color-code boxes like <i>red for fragile</i> and <i>blue for kitchen</i>. Number them sequentially from Box 1 to 25.</p> <p>Video each pallet or load with a spoken count. Include timestamped photos of truck departure. Capture furniture protection like plastic wrap and corner guards.</p> <p>Use a free app like Sortly to scan <b>QR codes</b> on boxes. This builds a detailed <b>box inventory</b> for unpacking. It aids damage claim prevention later.</p> <p>Review footage with witnesses if possible. Store in cloud storage with metadata. This photo evidence strengthens dispute resolution for move-in day prep.</p> <h3>Document Building Entry Process</h3><img alt="Document Building Entry Process" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/nyc-movein-day-prep-what-to-photograph-document-and-confirm(awx8)_3.jpeg"/> <p>Capture video of <b>truck parking location</b> and building entrance before unloading begins to establish legal parking rights. GPS pin the spot via your phone map app. Note any street parking rules.</p> <p>Record a 360-degree video of <b>parking spot markings</b>. Photograph No Parking signs and their expiration times. NYC fines for double parking reach $115, so document carefully.</p> <p>Video discussions between movers and the super about <b>loading zone access</b>. Include elevator availability and lobby path. This confirms landlord obligations for smooth entry.</p> <p>Timestamp all recordings for the <b>move-in date</b>. Backup files immediately. This pre-move documentation protects against access disputes in your New York City rental.</p> <h2>During Unloading: Building Logistics</h2> <p>Building damage claims during NYC moves average $1,200; protect yourself by <b>documenting shared spaces</b> throughout unloading. NYC Multiple Dwelling Law 78 requires landlords to maintain common areas like elevators and hallways. Capture photo evidence and video to avoid disputes over scuffs or dents.</p> <p>Check <b>elevator weight limits</b>, typically 2,500 lbs, and confirm with the super before starting. Use hallway protection like carpet runners or padding to shield floors and door frames. This prevents cross-tenant disputes and supports your move-in checklist.</p> <p>Coordinate with building staff for smooth access. Note any delays in the elevator or lobby that could affect your <b>unloading timeline</b>. Keep records to reference tenant rights during dispute resolution.</p> <p>During the process, photograph the <b>building entrance</b> and lobby too. Timestamp everything for your <b>pre-move documentation</b>. This builds a strong case if issues arise with your security deposit.</p> <h3>Capture Elevator and Hallway Conditions</h3> <p>Take before/after elevator door photos + hallway floor protection video using this 4-step protocol. Start with <b>elevator interior</b> shots of walls, floors, mirrors, and buttons. Take at least eight timestamped photos from different angles.</p> <ol><li>Photograph <b>elevator walls and mirrors</b> for existing scuffs or smudges.</li> <li>Check and snap <b>hallway floors</b>, ensuring carpet protectors are down.</li> <li>Document <b>door frames</b> with padding installed, noting any pre-existing dents.</li> <li>Record a video of the <b>mover path</b> from lobby to apartment door.</li></ol> <p>Use <b>painter's tape</b> to mark pre-existing damage, adding dates like <i>"7/15 scuff"</i>. This creates clear <b>before photos</b> for your apartment inspection. Upload to cloud storage for backup.</p> <p>Repeat shots after unloading for <b>after photos</b>. Compare with your condition report to confirm no new damage. Involve a witness if possible for added protection.</p> <h3>Note Delivery Times and Staff Interactions</h3><img alt="Note Delivery Times and Staff Interactions" width = "616px" src="https://files.autoblogging.ai/images/nyc-movein-day-prep-what-to-photograph-document-and-confirm(awx8)_4.jpeg"/> <p>Log exact arrival/departure times and super interactions in Notes app to establish timeline for any disputes. Start with truck arrival, like <i>"9:15AM - Truck arrives at building entrance"</i>. Note super unlocking elevator next.</p> <ul><li>Record <b>truck arrival time</b> and parking spot confirmation.</li> <li>Log <b>super name and contact</b> on paper, plus key handover details.</li> <li>Track <b>first load complete</b> and any access delays.</li> <li>Note departure, like <i>"12:30PM - Final items unloaded"</i>.</li></ul> <p>Reference NYC move-in noise ordinances, typically 8AM-10PM weekdays. Document staff instructions on <b>elevator use</b> or building amenities like laundry room access. This supports your lease agreement terms.</p> <p>Save logs with timestamped photos for the full record. Share with movers if delays occur due to superintendent contact issues. Use this for maintenance requests or damage claim prevention later.</p> <h2>Unpacking and Setup: Interior Documentation</h2> <p>Document apartment condition immediately after unloading but before furniture placement using systematic <b>room-by-room photos</b>. NYC courts accept <i>day-of-move photos</i> as equal to pre-move documentation. This approach creates strong photo evidence for your move-in checklist.</p> <p>Furniture-free photos prevent pre-existing damage behind couch claims by landlords. Capture timestamped photos with metadata showing the move-in date. Store them in cloud storage for backup files during any dispute resolution.</p> <p>During unpacking, confirm <b>landlord obligations</b> like working smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms. Note any issues on the condition report and inventory list. This supports tenant rights under New York City rental laws.</p> <p>Plan your <b>unpacking plan</b> around documentation first. Test electrical outlets and light fixtures before box inventory. Witnesses during this step add credibility to your records.</p> <h3>Photograph Walls, Floors, and Fixtures</h3> <p>Take 40+ empty-room photos covering these 10 categories before placing any furniture using furniture-free layout. Start with <b>walls, floors, and ceilings</b> in each space. Use an 18% gray card for accurate white balance in your shots.</p> <p>In the <b>living room</b>, snap six photos: four corners, entry, and window. Check for <i>cracks, stains, scuffs</i> on paint condition and hardwood floors. Document windows, doors, and locks thoroughly.</p> <ul><li><b>Kitchen</b>: Eight photos of empty counters, clear floors, cabinets, countertops, sink, faucet.</li> <li>Include <b>appliances</b> like refrigerator, oven, stove, dishwasher, microwave for functionality.</li> <li><b>Bedroom</b>: Six photos per room showing closets, shelves, mirrors, and carpet or tiles.</li></ul> <p><b>Bathroom</b> needs eight photos: shower, tub empty, toilet, bathroom fixtures, tiles for mold or water damage. Test plumbing issues and faucets. Note any dents or pre-existing damage.</p> <h2>Post-Move-In: Final Confirmations</h2> <p>Complete final walkthrough inspection with your landlord using a signed move-in checklist plus photo verification to legally establish baseline condition. This step protects your security deposit under NYC Rent Stabilization Code 2524.4, which requires detailed condition reports. You have a 30-day window for any disputes, so document everything thoroughly.</p> <p>During the apartment inspection, check walls, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, locks, appliances like the refrigerator, oven, stove, dishwasher, and microwave. Note cabinets, countertops, sink, faucet, bathroom fixtures, toilet, shower, bathtub, tiles, carpet, hardwood floors, paint condition, cracks, stains, scuffs, dents, mold, or water damage. Also verify plumbing issues, electrical outlets, light fixtures, smoke detectors, carbon monoxide alarms, HVAC system, air conditioner, heating, closets, shelves, and mirrors.</p> <p>Confirm keys, key handover, parking spot, storage unit, balcony, fire escape, elevator, building entrance, lobby, superintendent contact, utility setup, electricity meter, gas meter, water meter, internet wiring, and cable outlets. Get dual signatures on the condition report to meet landlord obligations and tenant rights in New York City rentals. This prevents future damage claim disputes.</p> <p>Take timestamped photos and video recordings of every area, including furniture placement after initial unpacking. Store in cloud storage with backup files, and consider witnesses for the move-in date. Reference your lease agreement for sublet confirmation, pet policy, noise rules, building amenities like gym access, laundry room, roof deck, doorbell, mailbox, and smart lock.</p> <h3>Verify Inventory Against Photos</h3> <p>Cross-reference your <b>Sortly inventory</b> against physical boxes using this 5-step verification before full unpacking. Start by setting up an <b>empty staging area</b> in the living room to organize boxes clearly. This matches your pre-move documentation with on-site items for accurate tracking.</p> <p>Scan all QR codes on labeled boxes to log contents digitally against your inventory list. Note any damaged boxes with timestamped photos capturing dents, tears, or water stains right away. For example, photograph a ripped box holding kitchenware next to its QR code scan result.</p> <ol><li>Empty staging area in living room.</li> <li>Scan all QR codes.</li> <li>Note damaged boxes with photos.</li> <li>Create 'Damaged Items Report' spreadsheet.</li> <li>Get mover/landlord acknowledgment.</li></ol> <p>File the report with insurance within 48 hours to support damage claim prevention. Have the mover and landlord initial the spreadsheet for dispute resolution. This ties into your unpacking plan and box inventory for smooth move-in day prep.</p> <h3>Document Meter Readings and Signatures</h3> <p>Photograph final <b>meter readings</b> plus get landlord signature on condition checklist using this legal template before utilities transfer. Capture electricity meter, gas meter, and water meter dials clearly with timestamps for ConEd transfer protocols. Include surrounding areas to show no tampering.</p> <p>Complete and initial the <b>8-page move-in checklist</b> covering lease start date, rent payment method, maintenance request process, pest control, garbage disposal, recycling bins, street parking, subway access, and neighborhood orientation. The landlord must sign the official <b>Move-In Condition Report</b> to fulfill NYC rental requirements. Both parties keep dated copies.</p> <ol><li>Re-photograph all meters.</li> <li>Complete/initial 8-page move-in checklist.</li> <li>Landlord signs Move-In Condition Report.</li> <li>Scan/email copies to both parties + attorney.</li> <li>Create ZIP file archive on external drive.</li></ol> <p>Scan and email all documents immediately for records, then archive in a ZIP file on an external drive with metadata intact. This ensures photo evidence for any future walkthrough inspections or initialed checklist reviews. Experts recommend this for protecting tenant rights during security deposit returns.</p>
